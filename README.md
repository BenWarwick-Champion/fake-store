# Fake Store

Another simple React + Typescript project where I have created a store front using the [fakestoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

You should be able to add items to the shopping cart and adjust the items which are in your cart as well.

Find a link to the [live demo here](https://benwarwick-champion.github.io/fake-store).
